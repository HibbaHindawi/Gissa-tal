create new random numbergenerator

create three variables
create variable one (variable one is the random number that is going to be used and is selected from a range of 1-100)
create (variable two is the variable that lets the user input guesses, puts first value to 0)
create (variable three is a variable that counts the amount of inputs that variable two gets, puts first value to 0)

ask user to guess a number

starts a loop for everytime variable two != variable one
converts variable two into a int32 and puts value to an input number string
first guess is input

looks if number is higher or lower than variable one and stops when variable two is variable one
if wrong then write "number is lower/higher than the chosen number"
changes console color and text color to red everytime its wrong
gives you a guess again until you get to variable one and adds +1 to variable three for every loop

if variable two = variable one
changes console color and text to green
write "well done" + variable three
